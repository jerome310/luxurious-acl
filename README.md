# Shopify Clone Steps
1) Create a blank repo and connect your new project to that repo (Do not clone bernard repo into your created shopify project it pop up with errors)
2) Create all the FOLDERS that's needed for a Shopify theme using the project named "Elizabeth_Clean" zip file that you have in your desktop and just grab the FOLDERS NOT THE FILES INSIDE
* Key Note: If you see this "error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jerome310/acl_3D_Store.git'" in the command line when you're trying to create a new repo for your shopify project you have to do 2 things: 1) Go to the last project you did and use this command: "git pull origin main" that'll bring down all the updated changes to your project and 2) You have to create some sort of file like index.html and add something inside the file and then push that  change, it'll go to the repo you're trying to connect your project to and you should be good recheck if everything worked for your repo.
3) Copy the FILES now and move them inside the folders that they're suppose to be located
4) Use these commands: git init, git add ., git commit -m 'put a description', git push
5) FINALLY you're done with creating your shopify github repo
